at first i use dynamic analysis to find out the messageboxA through Ollydbg
then i find the method with comment that print out the message that you are succeed or fail for trying password
jump back to the location where call this method
it starts at 00401245 and 0040124C
then look up
the comment CMP EAX, EBX is the switch to these two method
then look up and see where EAX and EBX's data come from
there are two CALL comment in front of EAX and EBX
0040137E and 004013D8
then use IDA to find these two function
0040137E is to switch the input to upper letter and add them together
finally xor it with 4567h
we got the encoding text
the second function is to pick each char for the input and minus 30
times the register with 30h then add the calculation i did above
stop until the last bit
then we got another encoding text
if these two text is the same
that's the username and password
